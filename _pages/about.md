# About
Hi! I am Niklaus (Yi) Liu, a former research assistant at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) in Singapore, and currently a research assistant at James J.Q. Yu Lab of [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), Shenzhen. I received my B.S. from the [School of Data Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University](http://www.hlju.edu.cn/) (**one year in advance**). I am currently seeking **PhD opportunities** (preferably for a partnership between USA, Australia and Germany) at the interface between security and privacy in machine learning, federated learning and IoT. Do not hesitate to [[**connect with me**]](mailto:97liuyi@gmail) if you are interested! 

Most of my previous work focused on S&P in machine learning and data science in IoT, where I spent nearly two years learning the **TensorFlow** framework and **machine learning algorithms**. I participated in the [**Dominant Dataset Selection Algorithms for Time-Series Data Based on Linear Transformation**](https://niklausliu.github.io/publication/paper-1) project, and the papers in this project will be published in the **IEEE IoT Journal (Top journal)**. I also participated in the [**Heilongjiang Province Informatization Development Level Evaluation Report**](http://114.115.151.206/) project, including data preprocessing, data visualization, machine learning models, and visualization sites. Topics I'm studying include security and privacy in machine learning, security and privacy in smart cities, and federated learning, all of which are related to security and privacy because security and privacy are the most important topics of the future.
