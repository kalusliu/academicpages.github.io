# About
Hi! I am Niklaus (Yi) Liu, a former research assistant at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) in Singapore, and currently a research assistant at James J.Q. Yu Lab of Shenzhen [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). I received my B.S. from the [School of Data Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University](http://www.hlju.edu.cn/) (**one year in advance**) and I will be going to **PhD** in [Monash University, Australia](https://www.monash.edu/). My research interests include but are not limited to data privacy, machine learning, smart city and IoT.

Most of my previous work focused on data mining and data privacy protection, where I spent nearly two years learning the **TensorFlow** framework and **machine learning algorithms**. I participated in the [**Dominant Dataset Selection Algorithms for Time-Series Data Based on Linear Transformation**](https://niklausliu.github.io/publication/paper-1) project, and the papers in this project will be published in the **IEEE IoT Journal**. I also participated in the [**Heilongjiang Province Informatization Development Level Evaluation Report**](http://114.115.151.206/) project, including data preprocessing, data visualization, machine learning models, and visualization sites. Topics I'm studying include security and privacy in machine learning, security and privacy in smart cities, and federated learning, all of which are related to privacy and security, because security and privacy are the most important topics of the future.
