Project
=======
* Oct. 2017-July 2018: Leader
  * Heilongjiang University 
  * Title: Decision tree model in the diagnosis of breast cancer.
  * The decision tree model was constructed by five characteristics of the breast cancer dataset. The model identified the benign and malignant accuracy of breast cancer as **95.7%**.
  
* July 2017-Present: Research Assistant
  * Title: Dominant Dataset Selection Algorithms for Time-Series Data Based on Linear Transformation (**NATIONAL PROJECT**)
  * We propose a affine model with greedy algorithms and scanning algorithms to achieve large data scale into small data scale within a certain error range.
* Jan. 2019-Present: Leader
  * We propose a PPGAN model, in which we implement the differential privacy in GANs by adding **well-designed noise** to the gradient during the model learning procedure.
  * The paper is **coming soon**. (Submited ICPADS 2019)
